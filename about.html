<h3>About Me</h3>
I’m a Web and Mobile Developer living in Honolulu, HI. I started making websites in 1997 with HTML and Javascript. I re-branded my freelance web design and development company from my personal name to <a href="http://freshblocks.com">Fresh Blocks LLC</a> where I developed applications for the Apple iPhone and iPad. I have also worked on the <a href="http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MarApr04/Joint_Medical_Asset.htm"><abbr title="Joint Medical Asset Repository">JMAR</abbr></a> project for the <abbr title="Department of Defense">DoD</abbr> and created internal web applications for Kaiser Permanente. A more in-depth list of my skills and work experience can be found on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johntwang">LinkedIn</a> profile or on my <a href="http://www.johntwang.com/resume">Resumé</a>.

<h3>About This Site</h3>
This site serves as a personal space separate from my work at <a href="http://ikayzo.com">Ikayzo</a>. It is also provides me with a space to exercise new things that I am learning. Thus it is very experimental in nature and will change from time to time. As such, a page might not work in your browser or it make just go completely crazy. Please accept my apologies.

The site is created with HTML and CSS, and uses WordPress for publishing.

<h3>Furthermore</h3>
I have passion for simplicity, learning new things and just about everything web and mobile.
