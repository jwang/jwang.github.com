### About Me
I’m a Software Engineer currently living in Honolulu, HI. I started making websites in 1997 with HTML and Javascript. I then re-branded my freelance web design and development company from my personal name to <a href="http://freshblocks.com">Fresh Blocks LLC</a> where I developed applications for Apple iPhone and iPad as well as Google Android. I have also worked on the <a href="http://www.almc.army.mil/alog/issues/MarApr04/Joint_Medical_Asset.htm"><abbr title="Joint Medical Asset Repository">JMAR</abbr></a> project for the <abbr title="Department of Defense">DoD</abbr> and created internal web applications for Kaiser Permanente. I currently work at Ikayzo, where I create web apps using Ruby on Rails and Mobile Apps for Google Android and Apple iOS. A more in-depth list of my skills and work experience can be found on my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/johntwang">LinkedIn</a> profile.

### About This Site
This site serves as a personal space separate from my work at <a href="http://ikayzo.com">Ikayzo</a>. It is also provides me with a space to exercise new things that I am learning. Thus it is very experimental in nature and will change from time to time. As such, a page might not work in your browser or it make just go completely crazy. Please accept my apologies.

The site is created with HTML5, CSS3, and uses <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> Pages for publishing. You can find the source code for this site at the <a href="https://github.com/jwang/jwang.github.com">GitHub repository</a>. The content is written using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> via a combination of <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> and <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/">iAWriter</a> for the Mac.

### Furthermore
I have passion for simplicity, learning new things and just about everything web and mobile.
