These are some of the great Third Party Developer Tools out there for Cocoa developers. I've used these on mostly a daily basis and others on an as needed basis. They're very handy and have saved me quite a lot of time and typing. Hopefully they'll be as useful to you, as they have been for me.

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://www.kevincallahan.org/software/accessorizer.html">Accessorizer</a> - Code generation for pretty much everything you'll ever need in Cocoa development.</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.mugunthkumar.com/products/mac-app-iconify/">IConify</a> - Drag in an image and it'll generate the icon files for your iOS app. XCode comes with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Developer_Tools#Icon_Composer">Icon Composer</a> which can help as well.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.chimpstudios.com/appscanner/">App Scanner</a> - scans your app for private API calls, so you can check before you submit it to the App Store for review.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.loc-suite.org">Localization Suite</a> - Everything you need to get your Cocoa app localized, minus someone to actually translate the words and phrases.</li>
	<li><a href="http://codepilot.cc/">Code Pilot</a> - Quick project navigation through files</li>
	<li><a href="http://fileability.net/ingredients/">Ingredients</a> - Cocoa Documentation Viewer</li>
</ol>
Some are free, others are not.
