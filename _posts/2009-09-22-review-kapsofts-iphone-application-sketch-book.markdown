Designing an iPhone app? The concept isn't much different from designing a website. At least for me it's not. The primary process includes sketches that are used in meetings with either team members or clients before jumping into either OmniGraffle or Photoshop. The general idea is to stay away from the computer as much as possible in the initial design process to let creativity flow and not restrict yourself to the pixels on the screen.

If you've either taken or watched the Stanford iPhone Dev course from iTunesU (<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/cgi-bin/index.php" target="_blank">CS193P</a>), then you have heard them constantly enforce the idea of sketching out your app screens and functionality before coding. Those who do web design will likely vouch for the same process. This is where Dean Kaplan saw an opportunity. He has created an <a href="http://mobilesketchbook.com/" target="_blank"> iPhone Application Sketch Book</a>.

<blockquote>I happened to be auditing the Stanford iPhone Programming course, says Kaplan, and one of the guest speakers discussed how he went about creating his user interface designs. Paper was one option he mentioned. Almost instantly the notebook idea light bulb went off. Other options of various computer programs were mentioned, but it always got back to paper and pencil. Subsequently, I did my own online survey that revealed designers prefer paper 95% of the time. - <a href="http://theappleblog.com/2009/08/19/sketch-book-makes-designing-iphone-apps-easier/" target="_blank">theAppleBlog</a></blockquote>

The sketchbook contains 100 grid pages with an iPhone designed to scale on it. Each page has it's own header that allows you to put in the name of the app and the name of the screen. The pages are big. There is ton of free space for taking side notes during group sessions and team meetings. The notebook itself is paperback, plastic spiral bound, and can be ordered from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IE2ZK4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jotwa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002IE2ZK4" target="_blank">Amazon.com for $14.99</a>.
<h4>Q & A with Dean Kaplan</h4>
<ol>
	<li> What are your plans for the future of the sketchbook?
<em>"There will be a huge exciting announcement concerning the book next week. Stay tuned."</em><br /></li>
	<li> Do you plan on creating a Stencil Kit similar to The Design Commission's one? Or perhaps making the iPhone on the pages slightly larger to be more compatible with the Stencil Kit?
<em>"LOL. Are you spying on me? As for size. I guess you are saying size matters. And I'm listening to feedback and it is likely that you might see a version that is 1.5X actual very soon. (DC's stencil is smaller then 1.5x and I don't think its very useable. )"</em><br /></li>
	<li> Have you considered perforated pages for easier tear-off?
<em>"I've heard the perforated request once before. Not likely on that one. As one reviewer told me he like to tear the pages right out of the book and paste them on the frig.)"</em><br /></li>
	<li> A folder built-in either the front or back cover for keeping materials given from other team members or clients together?
<em>"I love that idea. It crossed my mind a few months ago. Likely in a future UBER Sketch Book."</em></li>
</ol>
<h4>The Good</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Keeps all your apps and screens together instead of having multiple pieces of paper that can get easily lost.</li>
	<li>Grid pages are very handy for going from sketching to computer rendering.</li>
	<li>To scale iPhone keeps you in the restriction of the small space while also reminding you to beware of your font sizes.</li>
	<li>Cheap. $15! If you're just getting into iPhone app design, this can definitely help you on your way in keeping your ideas organized.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Bad</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Not compatible with The <a href="http://www.designcommission.com/shop">Design Commission</a> has created an <a href="http://www.designcommission.com/shop/iphone-stencil-kit/" target="_blank">iPhone Stencil Kit</a>. Different companies, Can't really complain.</li>
	<li>The to scale iPhone on the page is also a bit harder to draw stuff inside it.</li>
	<li>Since there's no stencil, you need to keep in mind what you get with the SDK and what needs to be custom made. Thought it's not that big of a deal.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
Right now, I'm using a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/8883701135?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jotwa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=8883701135" target="_blank">Moleskine Squared Notebook</a> to do my sketches for iPhone apps and other web related work. It's much smaller than the iPhone sketchbook, but it does allow me to put other thoughts and ideas inside. For what the purpose it was designed for, the iPhone sketchbook delivers and does so very well. Compatibility with the Stencil Kit would definitely put it over the top. The last things that I would like included in the sketchbook, would be a small folder built in and perforated pages. Those are some very small personal requests though.
