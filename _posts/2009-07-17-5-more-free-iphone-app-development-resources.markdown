	<li>
<h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/iphone-exif/">iphone-exif</a></h3>
An Exif Tag library editor that enables direct viewing and editing of EXIF Meta Data tags in Jpeg files on the iPhone. The most obvious use is to manage Geo location tags into the image. However, it is also possible to edit any of the Exif tags or add your own that are not in the spec.
This is really useful for image uploads from the phone for sites like Picasa and Flickr.</li>
	<li>
<h3><a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/">json-framework</a></h3>
This framework implements a strict <a rel="nofollow" href="http://json.org/">JSON</a> parser and generator in Objective-C. You get free XML parsing support from the official iPhone SDK, but not JSON support. This is a way to add it.</li>
	<li>
<h3><a href="http://github.com/sjlombardo/openssl-xcode/tree/master">openssl framework</a></h3>
<a href="http://github.com/sjlombardo/openssl-xcode/tree/master"> </a>It is specifically intended for use in building secure iPhone
applications alongside SQLCipher (http://www.zetetic.net/software/sqlcipher).</li>
	<li>
<h3><a href="http://github.com/kailoa/iphone-smtp/tree/master">iphone-smtp</a></h3>
This code implements a quick class for sending one off messages via SMTP on the iPhone.</li>
	<li>
<h3><a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/">cocos2d</a></h3>
<a href="http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org/"> </a>framework for building 2D games, demos, and other graphical/interactive applications. It is based on the cocos2d design: it uses the same API, but instead of using python it uses objective-c.</li>
