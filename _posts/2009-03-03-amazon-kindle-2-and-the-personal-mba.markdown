First of all, let's get the disclaimer out. I am in not saying in any way shape or form that <a href="http://personalmba.com/">The Personal MBA</a> is a replacement for an accredited MBA University program. Ok. Now with that out of the way, I pre-ordered the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/ref=amb_link_83624371_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=072G0X2N0792H3S10H2T&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=469942651&amp;pf_rd_i=507846"> Amazon Kindle 2</a> shortly after it was announced on February 9th. I did receive it on February 24th and was able to queue up books to be delivered on first activation of the Kindle. I'm not going to review the Kindle 2 itself. For that you can read <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2009/02/26/amazon-kindle-2-review/">Engadget's review</a> or <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5159749/gizmodos-amazon-kindle-2-review-matrix">Gizmodo's review</a>.

<h3>The Personal MBA</h3>
The Personal MBA has a list of<a href="http://personalmba.com/best-business-books/"> 77 recommended books</a>. And that's what I am going to go through. As a freelancer and entrepreneur, Business Management is something of extreme value to me. And going to Business School for an MBA right now is not an option. Even so, I am one of those people who like to consistently be learning something new. And with the Personal MBA, I am learning how to better run my Freelance business.

<h3>A Kindle?</h3>
I originally wanted to get the Kindle for a few other reasons. These reasons are:
<ul>
	<li>Being "green" or "environmentally friendly"</li>
	<li>Ability to carry multiple books without the added weight.</li>
	<li>Taking notes and wireless downloading</li>
</ul>

When researching if the Kindle would be a good fit for the Personal MBA, the main concept was the availability of the 77 Books in Kindle format. After going through the list, I found that 39 of the 77 books are available in Kindle format. Which means that 38 books are <em>not</em>. That's 1 book over half. 2 if you count that one of the books is <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">37 Signals' Getting Real</a>, which is available for free reading online.

<h3>Cost</h3>
The cost of the Kindle version of the books are not considerably cheaper than the paperback versions. If you are looking at hardcover books though, then it is a pretty penny. While, the cost is a pretty big deal for me as a freelancer, space was more of an issue. I have a fairly small office and having 77 books in addition to Web Design and Development books can get a bit out of control. It is important to remember that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Amazons-Wireless-Reading-Generation/dp/B00154JDAI/ref=amb_link_83624371_1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-1&amp;pf_rd_r=072G0X2N0792H3S10H2T&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=469942651&amp;pf_rd_i=507846">Kindle</a> itself costs $359 alone.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Overall, I am very happy to see that a large portion of the Personal MBA's recommended books are available in Kindle format and have found reading on the Kindle to be very comfortable and easy use. I have also managed to convert a few PDF books to Kindle format and will discuss those in a future entry related to using the Kindle 2 as a Web Designer and Developer's research tool.
