There are to 2 very popular Wordpress plugins for catch-all content sharing: <a href="http://yoast.com/wordpress/sociable/">Sociable</a> and <a href="http://sharethis.com/wordpress">ShareThis</a>. They are both very good. And they each come with their associated pros and cons. Here's a quick look at them in terms of a web designer's blog use.

<strong>What Both Have and Don't Have</strong>

Together they provide sharing capabilities to the large major sharing services such as Digg, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Delicious, Twitter, etc. They also both provide sharing capability through email and printing. They are also both customizable to some extent. You can choose which services are available to be shared to. Sociable provides 98 services and ShareThis provides 36. Also, noteworthy for designers, neither plugins offer <a href="http://www.designbump.com">DesignBump</a> as an option.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Overall Conclusion</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">They're both great. You can't really go wrong with either of them. I tend to favor Sociable more since it includes some designer-specific social sharing sites (DesignFloat and DZine.) At the same time, I very much like the small footprint of ShareThis.</p>
