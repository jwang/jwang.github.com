<p>On March 20th, I had the privilege of being a speaker at <a href="http://www.unconferenz.com">Unconferenz</a>. I also ended up hosting a couple of other talks throughout the day as well. I presented on the topic of Designing iPhone/iPad Apps and 3rd Party SDKs. The slides are available <a href="http://freshblocks.com/downloads/unconferenz2010.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>I learned quite a few lessons as a speaker about giving a better talk.</p>

<h3>Internet Access</h3>
<p>I didn't run into any problems on Internet Access at Unconferenz, but I did make sure to ask the host if there would be Internet access provided. I also brought along a personal USB 3G Modem as a backup.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Power actually could have been a problem. I currently use a MacBook Pro which about 2-3hrs of battery life. However, something to consider is the computer going to sleep mode while you're in the middle of a presentation. Also, the power outlet may not be somewhere remotely close to how long your power cable reaches. For this, I carry both my power adapter and also a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/RiteAV-ft-Power-Extension-Cord/dp/B000V1PAZS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1269589267&sr=8-1">10ft extension cable</a>. You may also want to be a kind person and bring a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Mini-Surge-Protector-Charger/dp/B0015DYMVO/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1269589226&sr=8-2">multi-outlet mini surge protector</a> so not to take the only one or 2 power outlet available.</p>
<h3>Backup Plan</h3>
<p>Always have a backup plan. The one thing that I did not have at all was a Mini-DisplayPort to VGA adapter for my laptop to connect to the projector. That was a bad thing. Luckily, someone at the conference did have one and I was able to borrow it. There was also a computer in the room that I could have used as another fallback as long as I had my presentation on a USB Key or uploaded somewhere like <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">DropBox</a> on the web.</p>
<h3>Contact Info</h3>
<p>I ran out of business cards. That was a bad thing. Always bring lots of those. I was lucky enough that some people had iPhones with the Bump app to swap contact info and also some who were willing to either give me theirs so I could contact them or just quickly add me to either <a href="http://twitter.com/johntwang">Twitter</a> or Gmail email address.</p>
<h3>Double-Check Everything, Maybe Even Triple-Check</h3>
<p>I had uploaded my slides ahead of time in case anyone wanted to download them. Unfortunately for me, I misspelled the file name and the link was dead. I quickly corrected the link and made sure to tweet it back out. That was very embarrassing to say the least. Make sure your stuff is set before you announce it.</p>
