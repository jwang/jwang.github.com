<p>Wacom's new <a href="https://direct.wacom.com/stores/5/product1.cfm?SID=5&Product_ID=1333&Category_ID=95">Intuos4 Art Pen</a> just finally began shipping last week. Previously, it had be on back-order since the release of the Intuos4 Tablet. I just got my hands on both the Intuos4 Art Pen and the <a href="https://direct.wacom.com/stores/5/Intuos_4_Professional_Accessor_P1450C65.cfm">Intuos4 Professional Kit</a>. Originally, I had planned to just purchase the Art Pen, but after user <a href="http://www.conceptart.org/forums/showthread.php?t=157928">Featherbeard on the ConceptArt forums</a> noted that it doesn't come with a Nib Extractor, I decided to just go ahead and get the Professional Kit as well. The Nib Extractor from the Professional Kit is the same as the one that comes with the <a href="http://www.wacom.com/intuos/">Intuos4 tablet</a> itself. </p><!--more-->
<h4>The Art Pen</h4>
<p>The Art Pen itself has a much bigger tip area than the Grip Pen that comes with the tablet. The Art Pen's bigger tip area also doesn't have the user swap-able color rings. One thing to note, the nibs do only fit in one way and they will rotate a bit during use. The nib won't fall out, so you don't have to worry about that when swapping nibs.</p>
<p>Even though the drivers for the Intuos4 are a bit old, they were able to successfully identify the Art Pen just fine from the start. Wacom just <a href="http://twitter.com/wacom/status/4380151090">updated drivers for the new Bamboo Touch series, Graphire and Cintiq tablets</a> for <a href="http://twitter.com/wacom/status/4378481905">Windows</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/wacom/status/4377856133">Mac OSX</a>, but the Intuos set hasn't been updated yet. As such, I still have to launch the 32-bit Settings for the tablet. Not a big deal.</p>
<p>After using the Art Pen with Corel Painter 11, I have noticed that I don't have much of a tactile response from the pen during barrel rotation. As such, it's really useful to have the Enhanced Brush Ghosting setting enabled while you get used to the feeling. It's quite a bit different than the Grip Pen. After spending a bit of time getting used to it, I was able to turn off the ghosting setting again.</p>
</p>
<h4>The Pen Stand</h4>
<p>The Art Pen stand also has exactly enough slots for all of the Nibs that come with the Art Pen with one nib in the pen itself. It also fits the Professional Kit's Nib Extractor in the middle spot of the stand just like the one that comes with the tablet and grip pen.</p>

<h4>The Nibs</h4>
<p>The Art Pen comes with 11 nibs. 1 on the pen itself and 10 replacement nibs. The 10 replacement nibs fit in nicely into the new housing of the Pen stand. The nibs have 1 shaft, just like the ones for all the other pens. This is a change from the <a href="https://direct.wacom.com/stores/5/Cintiq_21UX_6D_Art_Pen_P940C66.cfm">Intuos3 Art Pen's</a> nibs which previously had 2 shafts. The difference being that the 2 shafts on the Intuos3 version, prevented a rotation effect on the nib when rotating the Art Pen.</p>

<h4>The Details</h4>
<p>The following come in the box:
<br />
<ul>
<li>2 Chisel POM Nibs</li>
<li>2 Chisel Felt Nibs</li>
<li>3 Bullet POM Nibs</li>
<li>3 Bullet Felt Nibs</li>
<li>1 Pen Stand</li>
<li>1 Art Pen with 1 Bullet POM Nib inside</li>
</ul>
<strong>Model #:</strong> KP701E<br />
<strong>Price:</strong> $99.95</p>
<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>Although <a href="https://direct.wacom.com/stores/5/product1.cfm?SID=5&Product_ID=1333&Category_ID=95">Wacom's eStore</a> states: "The Intuos4 Art Pen ships with the following accessories: 10 replacement nibs, <strong>a nib puller</strong>, and a weighted pen stand." The package does <strong>NOT</strong> come with a nib puller. There was not one anywhere in the packaging and others from the ConceptArt forums have had the same results.</p>
<p>As for the Art Pen itself, I love it. Barrel rotation is definitely it's main feature and it does it extremely well. It's an amazing feature to have. Corel Painter 11 recognized the barrel rotation immediately, and it also works wonderfully with Illustrator using the 6D Art Brushes set or in Photoshop, by using the Wacom Brushes 3. All in all, it's the one additional pen for the tablet that I need. I have very little use for the classic pen, airbrush pen or inking pen.</p>
