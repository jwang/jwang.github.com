I participated in the <a href="http://www.honolulumarathon.org/">Honolulu Marathon</a> on December 14, 2008. The race started off with a bang. Actually a series of bangs. Prior to starting, there is a fireworks presentation for all the participants. 20,302 people started the race this year. And 20,058 finished. Starting off with pouring rain for the first 2 hours and 30 minutes. Later the weather started to clear up and the sun came out as the vast majority of people passed Kahala Mall and headed towards the halfway point in Aina Haina. It was a great to see the various costumed runners as well. There was a Pikachu, Yoda, <a href="http://cmsimg.honoluluadvertiser.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/bilde?Site=M1&amp;Date=20081215&amp;Category=NEWS01&amp;ArtNo=812150334&amp;Ref=V2&amp;Profile=1002&amp;MaxW=550&amp;MaxH=650&amp;Q=90&amp;title=0">Darth Vader</a>, many a santa hats and costumes, maids, brides, grooms, and many many more. It was definitely a great part of the event fun. Though, I did feel bad for them when the race started with pouring rain.

Once getting into Hawaii Kai, it was a very beautiful way to see the scenery and the overlook of the Hawaii Kai marina. Coming into the end of the run, it was very nice to see the sun overlooking the Waialea Beach Park from the top of the mountain hill. Around the half mile left mark, you can start to see the Finish line.

Unfortunately, I injured my right foot around the 11 mile marker and was forced to limp the remaining part of the marathon. While it was disheartening, I did finish and have fun participating in the event. I completed both of my goals for this marathon. Perhaps next time I will be able to run the entire marathon and post a better time.
