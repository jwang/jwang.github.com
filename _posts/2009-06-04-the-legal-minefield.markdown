<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am not a lawyer, law student or anything remotely close and/or in any way related to the law field.

That said, I do still have my own legal issues to be aware of. Recently, I have started up my own company, which brings even more legal nightmares. As for my design and development work, there are quite a bit of legal things that I needed to be aware of.
<h3>Copyright</h3>
These are pretty easy to register. At least in the U.S. it is. I'm not so sure about how other countries work. For the U.S. head on over to the <a title="U.S. Copyright Office Website" href="http://www.copyright.gov/">U.S. Copyright Office's website</a> and do the online registration. It costs about $35 per copyright. This is good for just about all design work and also includes the programming code.
<h3>Licenses</h3>
These are the ones that have most recently driven me crazy. You can license your code, design work, photos, etc with various different licenses such as <a title="Creative Commons" href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses">Creative Commons</a>, <a title="Open Source Licenses" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical">MIT, GNU and many more</a>. There are a lot of resources available online for these and <a title="Creative Commons" href="http://creativecommons.org/about/licenses/meet-the-licenses">Creative Commons</a> helps you pick the license you want to use. My confusion comes from having both a Copyright and License on the same material. As a general understanding, everything I write and put on my website is Copyrighted. But at the same time, I have some code that is freely available for downloading and modification under MIT license both on my website and also on <a title="GitHub" href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>.

Another issue I am working on figuring out all the legalities of, is how to properly license out work to a client. I have seen quite a few articles online and even some books stating that it's best to retain the Copyright for the websites I design and build, while licensing out the design to the client. That's a great idea, but there's no legal paperwork or explanation on how this whole process works. <a title="AIGA" href="http://cpm.aiga.org/content.cfm/copyright-basics-for-graphic-designers">AIGA</a> has a pretty good write-up for designers.

I'm still trying to figure this all out, but I have run into some good resources.
