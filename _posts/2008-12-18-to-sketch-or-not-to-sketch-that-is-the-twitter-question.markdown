I am sketcher. I like to draw out preliminary designs as much as possible. Even if it's just a layout or something relatively quick. I also use a Moleskine notebook to do all my sketches in. Yesterday, I posed a question to the Web Design community on Twitter. The responses were overwhelming. So overwhelming that it required me to break it out of it's original intention. Thanks everyone! Greatly appreciated!

<em>Question to all web designers:</em> Do you sketch/draw out your preliminary designs on paper first or just jump into Photoshop?

Thank you all so much for your insights. They were all greatly appreciated and helpful.

<strong>How about the readers? Do you sketch or jump straight into Photoshop?</strong>
