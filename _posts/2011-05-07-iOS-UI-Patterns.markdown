A few iOS Mobile UI Patterns Galleries have popped up over the past couple of years. They do a pretty good job at putting together A set of screenshots per objective, like launch screens, navigation bars, etc.

Here are 3 that I've run into and have heard many others talk about. Note that none of these currently have an iPad galleries. For iPad, I recommend checking out [ThoughtBot's](http://thoughtbot.com) great site, [LandingPad](http://landingpad.org)

* [Pattrns](http://pttrns.com)
* [Mobile UI Patterns](http://mobile-patterns.com)
* [LovelyUI](http://www.lovelyui.com)

I also haven't found one for Android and this is the best I've found so far [Android UI Patterns](http://www.androiduipatterns.com).

Please feel free to contribute in the comments and I shall add them to the list.
