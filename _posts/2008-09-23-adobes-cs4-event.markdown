<p>Today, Adobe held their web broadcast announcing the 4th version of their Creative Suite. It was an hour long session and definitely did not cover a lot of the new features and changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gizmodo has already written up a <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5053419/adobe-creative-suite-4-massive-upgrade-including-new-photoshop-premiere-and-more">brief summary</a> listing PDFs of "What's New" for each application along with the Press Release from Adobe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://vectips.com/tips/illustrator-cs4-announcment-round-up/">VectorTips</a> and <a href="http://www.gomediazine.com/design-tip/product-tip-review/adobe-illustrator-cs4-preview/">GoMediaZine</a> have taken a quick round-up of the new features of Illustrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some things to note, a slightly cheaper version of the Web Design Suite (<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/webstandard/">Web Standard</a>) is available, which does not include Adobe's Photoshop. It's basically Macromedia's old suite of Dreamweaver + Fireworks. Similarly, there's also a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/designstandard/">Design Standard edition</a>, which loses Dreamweaver, Fireworks and Flash, along with the "Extended" version of Photoshop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dreamweaver has gotten a new user interface (as have all of the applications.) More importantly, it has now gained support for <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a>. Definitely something useful for developers on the cheap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" title="Subversion Support" src="http://www.johntwang.com/images/subversion.JPG" alt="" width="380" height="105" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Other nice things that were added:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Live View - Integrated browser-like viewing mode for testing out interaction.</li>
	<li>Code Navigator - Live code highlighting during interactions to see what code is getting executed.</li>
	<li>Javascript framework support for JQuery.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Some things that I would have liked to see:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some API support for MoveableType, TypePad and/or WordPress.</li>
	<li>Support for Application Platforms like Google App Engine, Amazon's S3.</li>
</ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, it seems as though Dreamweaver will remain the standard solution for most PHP, ColdFusion, and XHTML/HMTL designers/developers. Pre-ordering is available through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=amb_link_7541242_2?ie=UTF8&amp;node=341028011&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=top-1&amp;pf_rd_r=0WQMCD4SH8RCNHXR9WPS&amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;pf_rd_p=440783601&amp;pf_rd_i=cs4">Amazon.com</a> with an estimated release date of November 14th. Though, the Press Release states late October.</p>
