<a href="http://freelancefolder.com">Freelance Folder</a> just released their ebook <a href="http://freelancefolder.com/the-unlimited-freelancer-is-on-sale-now/">The Unlimited Freelancer</a> and <a href="http://www.envato.com">Envato's</a> Collis Ta'eed just released <a href="http://rockablepress.com/books/rockstar-wordpress-designer/">How to be a Rockstar WordPress Designer</a>. And since I just finished reading Miles Burke's <a href="http://www.principlesofsuccessfulfreelancing.com/">The Principles of Successful Freelancing</a>, it seemed like a good time to see what else is coming down to a bookstore near you. Here are some of the books I'm looking forward to their release this year.

<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ruby3/programming-ruby-1-9">Programming Ruby 1.9: The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide by Dave Thomas, with Chad Fowler and Andy Hunt</a>
<em>Available March 2009</em>
This is the Pickaxe book, named for the tool on the cover. The original PickAxe was the first English-language book on Ruby. Each edition of the book tracks the latest Ruby release, and each is the definitive reference to Ruby. This time we've broken with tradition. This isn't a third edition. It's technically a separate book. That's because it reflects all the new features of Ruby 1.9, and we want both it and the second edition (which covers 1.8) to be available at the same time.
