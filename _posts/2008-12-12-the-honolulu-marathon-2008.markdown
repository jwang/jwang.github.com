I've always had goals. And one of them happen to be running in a marathon. I'll be doing that this Sunday, December 14th. It's going to be my first marathon. And I won't be alone. <a href="http://zenhabits.net/2008/12/im-running-the-marathon-this-weekend/">Zen Habit's Leo Babauta</a> is also running the same exact marathon, as is<a href="http://www.starbulletin.com/news/breaking/35928954.html"> Boston Red Sox Pitcher Hideki Okajima</a>. As the title says, we'll be doing the 36th Annual <a href="http://www.honolulumarathon.org">Honolulu Marathon</a>.

You can track our progress online at the <a href="http://www.sportstats.ca/liveresults/l.php">Sportstats website</a>. I am runner #9061, Leo is runner #8482, and Okajima is #37. The race starts at 5:00AM Hawaii Time. There will be just shy of 27,000 participants.

I have been following a<a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244-255-11937-0,00.html"> Runner's World</a> training routine as I needed to train on my own time. Others have been following the <a href="http://honolulumarathonclinic.org/">Honolulu Marathon Clinic</a>. A free clinic that gets together on Sunday mornings. Highly recommended if you're interesting in pursuing running the Honolulu Marathon.

<strong>I have 2 goals for this weekend's marathon.</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Have fun</li>
	<li>Finish</li>
</ol>
I'm very excited for it and I'm feeling very good. I believe I will be able to accomplish both of those goals. I have set aside all of my running items (ipod, shirt, shorts, shoes, socks, gels, powerbars, water bottle, etc.) I have no completion time goal and that should make it easier to take it easy if I need to.

I am also planning on stopping at every water aid station (every 2-3 miles) to drink water/gatorade slowly and walk a little bit after taking the water before running again.

While Leo won't be carrying a cell phone during the race, I will be. Would there be any interest in getting Twitter updates as I get past checkpoints? I had wanted to carry a small camera to take pictures as I went along, but that doesn't seem like a good idea anymore. Although, I will write a follow-up post with my experience running the race.

<strong>Have you run a marathon? Got any last minute advice? Good luck wishes?</strong>
