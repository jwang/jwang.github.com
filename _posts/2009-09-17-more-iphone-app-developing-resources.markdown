The folks over at Fuel Your Apps have created a nice post titled: <a href="http://www.fuelyourapps.com/an-ever-growing-iphone-resource-thread/" target="_blank">An Ever Growing iPhone Resource Thread</a>. It's worth checking out as it will likely be constantly updated to add new content.

Also of interest is the a new sketchbook from Kapsoft called <a href="http://mobilesketchbook.com/" target="_blank">The iPhone Application Sketch Book</a>. I'm currently waiting for my copy of it to come in and then will have a complete review of it.
