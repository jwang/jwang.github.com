Having been in Web Design for such a long time, I frequently get asked "Where/How do I start?" After thinking about it. It's a pretty hard question to answer. I needed to probe further and ask follow-up questions to fully understand what they were asking. It's easy to just point someone to Google and tell them to search for Web Design. They'll get a lot of information that way. Unfortunately, there's way too much information out there. Books, websites, magazines, blogs. It's <em>very</em> easy to get information overload and confused. It's also very easy to start off and go completely the wrong way and get discouraged. So I've compiled a small list of books and websites to help get you started. The vast majority of these did not exist when I started and I wish they had been.

As a beginner, there are a few key concepts that you should understand before hopping into your favorite text editor and hacking away. These concepts are: <em>Standards </em>and <em>Usability</em>. And these are the building blocks upon which your foundation is built. Just like a building with a bad foundation will collapse, so will a website. These resources are specifically aimed at giving you a clear and stable foundation to build on.
