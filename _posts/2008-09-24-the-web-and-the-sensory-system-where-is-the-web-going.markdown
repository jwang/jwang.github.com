### Sight ###
Web Interaction started out purely visual, obviously being the sense of Sight. This still is and will remain the most compelling and important aspect of the web. Where is Sight going? It's staying put on your monitors, but also going mobile. The iPhone has recently obtained 0.87% of the web browser market. This is without having _any_ Flash support. With the newly announced Google Android phone, <a href="http://www.t-mobileg1.com/g1-announcement.aspx">T-Mobile's G-1</a>, along with RIM's Blackberries getting better support, the web is sure to be going mobile.

### Hearing ###
Sound interaction of web design started well over 10 years ago with embedded midi and wav files. The main use was background music for users while browsing websites. At the time, this was very innovated, though very annoying when there was no option to turn off the background music. Now, the use of Mp3s are primarily used on musician websites to showcase their latest records, songs, or promote purchases. Sound effects are also present in just about every single Motion Picture website out there. Primarily embedded in Flash for user interaction of opening doors, drawers, or anything else Flash designers can think of. Where is Sound going? It may go mobile, it may not. It all depends on how well Flash mobile gets adopted, if at all. The large bandwidth required is a limitation that cell phone companies don't really want in their cell network. Remember, it's "unlimited" data, which isn't really "unlimited." Sound will not disappear, as it's the main way for bands, musicians and the like to showcase their hard work.

### Touch ###

Since Apple's introduction of the iPhone, the mobile and touch interaction has taken the world by storm. And Apple isn't the only one pushing Touch. Microsoft has their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/index.html">Surface</a> interface technology out and showcasing in some exclusive locations. Let's not forget HP just recently released their <a href="http://www.hp.com/united-states/campaigns/touchsmart/">TouchSmart PC</a>. Touch is also one of the most touted features of the new Windows 7 Operating System set to debut Summer of next year. Adobe has also hinted at the rise of the Touch generation in a slightly hidden new feature of their newly announced Photoshop CS4. The feature is currently Mac specific as Windows does not support Multi-touch. Where is Touch going? It's coming and coming strong. It'll be interesting to see how Adobe moves forward with Flash for touch and also how web designers and developers are going to create websites for the future.

### Taste and Smell ###
Taste and smell aren't here. And it's going to be a scary world if and when they do come.

Where do you all see the Web going forward?
