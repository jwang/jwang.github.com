After reading <a href="http://adellecharles.com">Adelle Charles</a> ( <a href="http://twitter.com/adellecharles">@adellecharles</a> ) review [<a href="http://www.fuelyourcreativity.com/are-you-freelance-material/">Are You Freelance Material?</a>] of <a href="http://www.principlesofsuccessfulfreelancing.com/">The Principles of Successful Freelancing</a> by Miles Burke ( <a href="http://twitter.com/milesb">@milesb</a> ), I decided to get the book as a Christmas present to myself.
<h3>Initial Impressions:</h3>
The book seemed very light and small. It has the traditional Sitepoint look and feel to it.
<h3>Finished Reading Impressions:</h3>
Miles does an excellent job with the many aspects to consider prior to starting freelancing. Even more so, he talks about his experiences and failures in embarking into freelancing. The book's chapters are very nicely broken down into well manageable sections. And the book is short enough to read on a long flight. Similar to the length of Steve Krug's <em>Don't Make Me Think!</em>

Miles takes us through the freelancing journey of 2 fictional individuals. At the end of each chapter, explaining their decisions on the principle emphasized in the chapter. And also provides various links to resources discussed in the chapters. Such as finance software examples and start-up cost examples.

I also liked that the book did not end with the completion of the first year, but also provide advice on where to go and what to do after success has come. Miles did an amazing job bringing out the hidden costs and fees that a lot of potential freelancers come across in their first year as a surprise. There is a lot of emphasis on proper planning before you leap into the sea. And rightfully so. Planning is by far one of the most important principles of success in any field. He goes through the do's and don't's for success very nicely.

While the book does center a bit around a web design freelancing aspect as that is Miles Burke's specialty, it is a very informative resource for anyone considering freelancing in any industry.

The book's <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/freelancer1/">Sitepoint website</a> provides an in-depth list of the chapters and descriptions as well as a free sample chapter to read before you decide if you want to purchase it.
<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>
I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. The material was very well written and did not overwhelm. I highly recommend it to anyone considering freelancing as a career and even those who have already taken the leap.
<h3>Your Thoughts?</h3>
Have you read the book? What did you think? Will you read the book?
