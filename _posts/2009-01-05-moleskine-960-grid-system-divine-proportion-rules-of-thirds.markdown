People are always talking about the importance of sketching as part of a process in web, logo, or graphic design. For example: <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sketchingincode">A List Apart</a>, <a href="http://www.davidairey.com/my-logo-design-process/">David Airey</a>, and <a href="http://psdtuts.com/drawing/the-role-of-sketching-in-the-design-process/">PSDTuts</a> all have an article putting some sort of emphasis on it. <a href="http://www.jasongraphix.com/about">Jason Beiard</a> also touches on it as part of his layout chapter in his book <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/article/principles-beautiful-web-design/3/">The Principles of Beautiful Web Design</a>. And even <a href="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/2008/12/18/to-sketch-or-not-to-sketch-that-is-the-twitter-question/">the Twitterverse of Web Designers gave an overwhelming response when asked about sketching</a>.

I can understand why people will bypass the sketching process in favor of jumping straight into Fireworks, Photoshop, or Illustrator as it does add a step and slow you down a bit. Even more so if you have access to a graphic tablet such as the <a href="http://www.wacom.com/intuos/index.php">Wacom Intuos</a> or <a href="http://www.wacom.com/cintiq/index.php">Cintiq</a>.

Personally, I don't mind the slow down and find it more helpful to do the sketching. I use a<a href="http://www.moleskine.com/eng/_interni/catalogo/Cat_int/catalogo_notebooks.htm"> Moleskine Large Squared Notebook</a>. It's a small grid notebook (13 x 21 cm) with 240 pages. Recently, I have been trying to incorporate the concepts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">The Divine Proportion</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">Rule of Thirds</a>, and <a href="http://960.gs/">960 Grid System</a> into some designs. But first, I needed to find a way to incorporate them into the Moleskine for sketching. Unfortunately for me, a few Google searches came back with empty results and I was left to do them myself.

<h3>The Divine Proportion</h3>
The magical irrational number 1.61803 (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_(letter)">phi</a>) that makes all things proportioned to it, aesthetically pleasing. I mostly just use this to separate content in website design. Divinely proportioning the Moleskine should be easy as it's dimensions of 13 x 21cm are within 0.2% of said <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio">Golden Ratio</a>. Anyways, the math comes out like this:

<strong>Horizontal format</strong>: 20/1.618 = 12.97 cm ~ 13cm (25 boxes.) That leaves us with 8cm (15 boxes) on the other side.

<a class="thickbox" title="Divine Proportion - Horizontally" href="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/golden_horiz.jpg"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-none" src="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/thumbs/thumbs_golden_horiz.jpg" alt="golden_horiz.jpg" /></a>
<strong>Vertical format:</strong> 13/1.618 = 8 cm (16 boxes) by 5 cm (10 boxes.)

<a class="thickbox" title="Divine Proportion - Vertically" href="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/golden_vertical.jpg"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-none" src="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/thumbs/thumbs_golden_vertical.jpg" alt="golden_vertical.jpg" /></a>
<h3>The Rule of Thirds</h3>
A simplified version of the Divine Proportion. And much easier to do without doing math. This was also the easiest to implement with the Squared Moleskine. The dimensions of the notebook I gave you previously (13 x 21 cm) does not really lend itself to making this easy. But, having painfully counted the number of actual squares and measuring them I found the notebook is also 25 x 41 boxes. So, I gave myself a rectangle with 1 box border on the right, 2 box border on the top, 3 box border on the bottom and half a box on the left. Making an internal box dimension of 36 x 24, which is easily divisible by 3.

<strong>Vertical format</strong>: 6 x 4

<a class="thickbox" title="Rule of Thirds - Vertically" href="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/rule_of_thirds.jpg"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-none" src="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/thumbs/thumbs_rule_of_thirds.jpg" alt="rule_of_thirds.jpg" /></a>
<h3>The 960 Grid System</h3>
<a href="http://960.gs/">The 960 Grid System</a> provides downloadable templates for PDF grid paper, Fireworks, OmniGraffle, Photoshop &amp; Visio, and CSS framework with demo HTML. That's pretty wonderful considering it's all free. The problem for me was, the PDF is not in my Moleskine and not the size of a Moleskine page. So it was back to doing more math. The 960 Grid System uses a 12 column or 16 column format. This was a bit more complicated. Probably the most complicated of all. Anyways, <a href="http://sonspring.com/">Nathan Smith</a> does a great job at explaining everything on the website. Of particular interest to me was the <em>Dimensions </em>section where I found the needed numbers to incorporate the columns into the notebook. Unfortunately, it was too difficult to incorporate it in a vertical format. At least for now. I may revisit it later. Below are the results.
<h4>12 Column - 0.5 box margins, 2.5 box column width</h4>

<h4>16 Column - 0.5 box margins, 1.5 box column width</h4>
<a class="thickbox" title="960 Grid System - 16 columns" href="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/16_col.jpg"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-none" src="http://www.johntwang.com/blog/wp-content/gallery/moleskine/thumbs/thumbs_16_col.jpg" alt="16_col.jpg" /></a>
