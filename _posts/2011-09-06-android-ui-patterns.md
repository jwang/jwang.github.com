I previous wrote about [iOS UI Patterns resources](http://johntwang.com/blog/2011/05/07/iOS-UI-Patterns/). There were 3 that I curated. At the time, I was having a hard time finding some for Android. I still am, but since thing, a new one has popped up. These 2 are the resources I've found:

* [Android Interaction Design Patterns](http://www.androidpatterns.com)
* [Android UI Design Patterns](http://www.androiduipatterns.com)

Also, there's always the [Android Developers Blog](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/) where every now and then a UI pattern post comes up. Like [this one on Twitter for Android's UI](http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/05/twitter-for-android-closer-look-at.html).

If you know of any others, please share. I'm always looking for them.
