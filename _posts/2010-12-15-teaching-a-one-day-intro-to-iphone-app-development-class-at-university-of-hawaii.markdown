No computer necessary, as the facilities will provide all the computers, network, and software required to build a working iPhone app. If you're interested in getting the app up and running on your iPod Touch, iPhone or iPad, you will need to be a paid Apple Developer. It costs $99 + tax per year. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">You can register for the Apple account here</a>.

This is an introductory course, designed for those students that are comfortable with their computers and willing to learn some very basic programming.

My goal is to get your comfortable with the technology and to have a lot of fun. Therefore, we will be results focused and will ensure that you have a working application before the end of the day!
