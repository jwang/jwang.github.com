<h3>It's Official</h3>
<p>I've started a web and mobile design/development company called <a href="http://www.freshblocks.com" title="Fresh Blocks LLC">Fresh Blocks</a>. The focus is on creating either website design and web apps or iPhone and Android apps. I've been working under the name since earlier this year, and the the small site launched for the company.</p>

<p>The idea of Fresh Blocks came around during a moment of "Designer's <em>Block</em>." Where I was looking for <em>fresh</em> ideas to work with. Hence the name of the company being born. A lot of work went into making sure the name was viable as a brand. ThinkVitamin has a great article about choosing a name: <a href="http://carsonified.com/blog/business/whats-in-a-name/">What's in a Name?</a> What we're trying to do is help individuals and businesses grow their online presence through the web and mobile web.</p>

<p>Here's to new beginnings! Head on over and say hello to <a href="http://www.freshblocks.com">Fresh Blocks</a>.

<h3>Further Education</h3>
<p>I've also registered as a Special Status Student at <a href="http://www.hpu.edu/">Hawaii Pacific University</a> for the <a href="http://www.hpu.edu/index.cfm?action=search.displaySearchCourseDetails&courseID=1715">Mobile Application Development course</a>. This course will be focusing on teaching both iPhone and Android Application Development. I'm looking forward to enhancing my knowledge of both the iPhone and Android SDK.</p>
